Revision history for Software-Catalog

0.04    2014-08-22 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes.

        - Rebuild and remove '# VALIDATE_ARGS' to make the built module works
          under Perl < 5.14 (because there is a change in Regexp stringification
          in 5.14).


0.03    2012-11-08 (SHARYANTO)

        - Require software ID to be [a-z0-9_]+ only (no more dashes), so it can
          be used as module name.


0.02    2012-11-08 (SHARYANTO)

        - Add get_software_info(). Add some more data. Some fixes/tweaks.


0.01    2012-11-08 (SHARYANTO)

        - First release (proof of concept).
